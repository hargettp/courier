[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hargettp/courier.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hargettp/courier)

NOTE: this library's support for TCP/IP transports is currently *broken*, due to a poor design for connection handling.

------------------

A basic message-passing library, intended for simplifying network applications.

Inspired by Erlang's simple message-passing facilities, courier provides roughly similar capabilities.  Applications simply 
create one or more endpoints, bind each to a transport using a given name, then can freely send / receive messages to
other endpoints just by referencing the name each endpoint bound to its transport.

A primary driver of courier's design is the ability of application writers to swap out the transport used for
delivering messages between endpoints without altering the logic of their application.  Many algorithms (such as for
distributed consensus) require a simplified message-passing facility in their implementation, and keeping the
transport implementation separate from the specific message passing protocol can simplify development and testing of
such algorithms.

The semantics of courier's use are simple:

 * An application sends and receives messages through an endpoint
 * Messages are just arbitrary bytestrings; application are free to construct / interpret them as needed
 * Endpoints are created with one or more transports
 * Sending messages is non-blocking and provides no feedback or guarantee regarding delivery; specific transports may, 
   however, provide out of band feedback regarding delivery
 * Receiving messages is by default blocking, although a blocking call with a timeout is available

Both in-delivery-order reception and selective out-of-order reception are supported: applications designers
are free to choose which style makes sense for a specific application.  The use of the latter technique
approximates an Erlang-style coding model, as messages selected witha supplied function are received before
other non-selected messages that are ahead of them in the queue.

A sample of use follows:

```haskell
module HelloWorld (
     main
 ) where

 -- Just import this package to access the primary APIs
 import Network.Endpoints

 -- A specific transport is necessary, however
 import Network.Transport.TCP

 -- Needed for serialization
 import Data.Serialize

 main :: IO ()
 main = do
    let name1 = "endpoint1"
        name2 = "endpoint2"
        resolver = resolverFromList [(name1,"tcp://localhost:2000"),
                                (name2,"tcp://localhost:2001")]
    transport <- newTCPTransport resolver
    endpoint1 <- newEndpoint [transport]
    endpoint2 <- newEndpoint [transport]
    Right () <- bindEndpoint endpoint1 name1
    Right () <- bindEndpoint endpoint2 name2
    sendMessage_ endpoint1 name2 $ encode "hello world!"
    msg <- receiveMessage endpoint2
    let Right txt = decode msg
        in print (txt :: String)
    Right () <- unbindEndpoint endpoint1 name1
    Right () <- unbindEndpoint endpoint2 name2
    shutdown transport   
```

To install, simply run the following in a shell:

```
cabal install courier
```

Or if using cabal-dev, run in a directory prepared with a cabal-dev sandbox:

```
cabal-dev install courier
```

With the  advent of sandboxes in Cabal 1.18, cabal-dev is no longer necessary,
just use an updated cabal for simplicity. The example assumes you are building
courier from source:

```
cabal clone https://github.com/hargettp/courier.git
cd courier
cabal sandbox init
cabal install --only-dependencies
cabal install
```

Successfully installed on both Linux 12.04 AMD64 and Mac OS X Mount Lion , using GHC 7.6.3.

TODO

 * Ensure that new transports can be defined outside of the courier package and used with courier endpoints
 * Consider adding support for RAW sockets
