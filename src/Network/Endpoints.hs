-- 'Endpoint's are a generalized abstraction for communication between parts of a program,
-- whether on the same physical host or distributed over a network. 'Endpoint's are intended
-- to simplify the development of network-centric applications by providing a small transport-independent
-- message-passing interface, and application writers can independently alter their implementation
-- by enabling their 'Endpoint's with different 'Transport's without modifying the logic of their
-- application that sends / receives 'Message's.

  Transports define specific implementations of message-passing techniques (e.g.,
  memory-based, TCP, UDP, HTTP, etc.). Typical use of the 'Endpoint's does not
  require direct use of 'Transport's, beyond creating specific 'Transport's (such as
  found in "Network.Transport.Memory" and "Network.Transport.TCP") and adding
  them to an 'Endpoint'.

Endpoints are a locus of communication, used for sending and receive messages.

Create a new 'Endpoint' using the provided transports.

{-|
Binding an 'Endpoint' to a 'Name' prepares the 'Endpoint' to receive
messages sent to the bound name.  Upon success, the result will be @Right ()@, but
if failed, @Left text-of-error-message@.

Invoke 'bindEndpoint', but ignore any returned result (success or failure).

{-|
Unbind an 'Endpoint' from a 'Name', after which the 'Endpoint' will eventually not 
receive messages sent to that 'Name'. Note that there is no guarantee that after 'Unbind'
succeeds that additional messages to that 'Name' will not be delivered: the only guarantee
is that eventually messages will no longer be delivered.
Upon success, the result will be @Right ()@ but
if failed, @Left text-of-error-message@.

{-|
Send a 'Message' to specific 'Name' via the indicated 'Endpoint'. While a successful
response (indicated by returning @Right ()@) indicates that there was no error initiating
transport of the message, success does not guarantee that an 'Endpoint' received the message.
Failure initiating transport is indicated by returning @Left text-of-error-message@.

A variant of 'sendMessage' for use when the return value can be ignored.

Helper for sending a single 'Message' to several 'Endpoint's.
-}
broadcastMessage :: Endpoint -> [Name] -> Message -> IO [(Either String ())]

Variant of 'broadcastMessage' that ignores the results of sending.

{-|
Receive the next 'Message' sent to the 'Endpoint', blocking until a message is available.
-}
receiveMessage :: Endpoint -> IO Message
receiveMessage endpoint = atomically $ readMailbox $ endpointMailbox endpoint

{-|
Wait for a message to be received within the timeout, blocking until either a message
is available or the timeout has occurred.  If a message was available, returns @Just message@,
but returns @Nothing@ if no message available before the timeout occurred.

{-|
Posts a 'Message' directly to an 'Endpoint', without use of a transport. This
may be useful for applications that prefer to use the 'Endpoint''s 'Mailbox'
as a general queue of ordered messages.
-}
postMessage :: Endpoint -> Message -> IO ()
postMessage endpoint message = do
    atomically $ writeMailbox (endpointMailbox endpoint) message

{-|
Select the next available message in the 'Endpoint' 'Mailbox' matching
the supplied test function, or blocking until one is available. This function
differs from 'receiveMessage' in that it supports out of order message reception.
-}
selectMessage :: Endpoint -> (Message -> Maybe v) -> IO v
selectMessage endpoint testFn = do
    msg <- atomically $ selectMailbox (endpointMailbox endpoint) testFn
    return msg

{-|
Wait for a message to be selected within the timeout, blocking until either a message
is available or the timeout has occurred.  If a message was available, returns @Just message@,
but returns @Nothing@ if no message available before the timeout occurred. Like
'selectMessage', this function enables out of order message reception.

{-|
Find a 'Message' in the 'Endpoint' 'Mailbox' matching the supplied
test function, or block until one is available.  Note that any such message
is left in the mailbox, and thus repeated calls to this function could find the
message if it is not consumed immediately.
-}
detectMessage :: Endpoint -> (Message -> Maybe v) -> IO v
detectMessage endpoint testFn = do
    msg <- atomically $ findMailbox (endpointMailbox endpoint) testFn
    return msg

{-|
Find a 'Message' in the 'Endpoint' 'Mailbox' matching the supplied
test function, or block until either one is available or the timeout expires.
Note that any such message is left in the mailbox, and thus repeated calls
to this function could find the message if it is not consumed immediately.

detectMessageTimeout endpoint delay testFn = do
  resultOrTimeout <- race (detectMessage endpoint testFn) (threadDelay delay)
  case resultOrTimeout of
    Left result -> return $ Just result
    Right () -> return Nothing

{-|
Dispatch the next available message in the 'Endpoint' 'Mailbox' matching
the supplied test function, or blocking until one is available. Once a
matching message is found, handle the message with the supplied handler
and return any result obtained. This function differs from 'receiveMessage'
in that it supports out of order message reception.
